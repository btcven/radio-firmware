# AODVV2

This document aims to explain the develoment process of the aodvv2 protocol , showing step by step the implementation of each related module in the process.

The  basic  operation  of  AODVv2 protocol are route discovery and route maintenance. Route 
discovery is  performed by  **sender node**  to a  **target node**  for which it does not have a valid route, and route maintenance is performed in order to avoid exiting eradicate routes from routing table and also to decrease packet dropping due to route breakage or node failure. This protocol can be work as both reactive and as proactive protocol. 


AODVv2 protocol implements three types of route messages during routing operations:
- Route Request (RREQ). 
- Route Reply (RREP).  
- Route Error (RERR). 
  
These are route control  messages used to  find and  maintain path from source node to any particular target node.

# AODVV2 PROTOCOL OPERATIONS

The AODVv2 protocol's operations include:
- managing sequence numbers. 
- Monitoring adjacent AODVv2 routers.
- Performing route discovery and dealing with requests from other routers.
- Processing incoming route information and updating the route table. 
- Suppressing redundant messages.
- Maintaining the route table and reporting broken routes. 

These processes are discussed in detail in the following sections. 


## Neighbor Table Update

On receipt of an RREQ or RREP message, the neighbor table MUST be checked for an entry with Neighbor.IPAddress which matches the source IP address of the message. If no matching entry is found, a new entry is created. 

A Neighbor Table is used to maintain information about neighboring AODVv2 routers. Neighbor Set entries are stored when AODVv2 messages are received.  

A new Neighbor Table entry is created as follows:

    Neighbor.IPAddress := Source IP address of the message
    Neighbor.State := Unknown
    Neighbor.ResetTime := INFINITY_TIME

When the link to the neighbor is determined to be bidirectional, the Neighbor Table entry is updated as follows:

    Neighbor.State := Confirmed

When the link to the neighbor is determined to be uni-directional, the Neighbor Table entry is updated as follows:

    Neighbor.State := Blacklisted
    Neighbor.ResetTime := CurrentTime + MAX_BLACKLIST_TIME

When the Neighbor.ResetTime is reached, the Neighbor Table entry is updated as follows:

    Neighbor.State := Unknown

When a link to a neighbor is determined to be broken, the Neighbor Table entry SHOULD be removed. 

Route requests from neighbors with Neighbor.State set to Blacklisted are ignored to avoid persistent IP packet loss or protocol failures. However, the reset time allows the neighbor to again be allowed to participate in route discoveries after MAX_BLACKLIST_TIME, in case the link between the routers has become bidirectional. 

# Route Discovery

During the Route discovery process, the originating node starts broadcasting of Route Request (RREQ) message throughout the network to find a path to a particular target node. Due to AODVv2 path accumulation function, each intermediate node will attach its own address  to the RREQ message. Each intermediate node that propagates the RREQ message makes a note to the backward path. Figure 3 shows AODVv2 route discovery process, node A is the source node and node I is the target node. Thus, node  A generates RREQ message which contains its own address,hop count, sequence number, target node address and then broadcast it on the network. Each intermediate node having a valid path to the target keeps on adding its own address and sequence number with the RREQ message as shown in figure 1  with nodes D and E, till target is reached. Upon sending RREQ message in the network,the source node waits for a RREP (route reply) message. The target node replies with RREP message.Incase no RREP is received within the particular wait time; the source node may try again by sending another RREQ message after some time to discover the route. In this way  AODVv2 discover the route from Source node  to target node. One of special feature of AODVv2 is energy efficient .If any node is low on energy; it has option to not engage in route discovery process.

## Generate a Route Request Message

Generate a route request message to find a route from OrigAddr to TargAddr using the given MetricType

**origAddr**   := IP address of Router Client which generated the packet to be forwarded.

**origPrefix** := prefix length associated with the Router Client.

**targAddr**   := destination IP address in the packet to be forwarded.

**targSeqNum** := sequence number in existing route to targAddr.

**mType**      := metric type for the requested route.




```cpp
Generate_RREQ(origAddr, origPrefix, targAddr, targSeqNum, mType)
{
    /* Increment sequence number in nonvolatile storage */
    mySeqNum := (1 + mySeqNum);

    /* Marshall parameters */
    outRREQ.HopLimit := MAX_HOPCOUNT;
    outRREQ.HopCount := 0;                              // if included 
    outRREQ.MetricType := mType;   //include if not DEFAULT_METRIC_TYPE
    outRREQ.OrigAddr := origAddr; 
    outRREQ.TargAddr := targAddr;
    outRREQ.OrigPrefixLen := origPrefix; //include if not address length
    outRREQ.OrigSeqNum := mySeqNum;
    outRREQ.TargSeqNum := targSeqNum;            //included if available
    outRREQ.OrigMetric := Route[OrigAddr].Metric;       //zero by default
    outRREQ.ValidityTime := limit for route to OrigAddr;   //if required 

    /* Build Address Blk using prefix length information from 
       outRREQ.OrigPrefixLen if necessary */
    AddrBlk := {outRREQ.OrigAddr, outRREQ.TargAddr};

    /* Include sequence numbers in appropriate Address Block TLVs */
    /* OrigSeqNum Address Block TLV */
    origSeqNumAddrBlkTlv.value := outRREQ.OrigSeqNum;
    /* TargSeqNum Address Block TLV */
    if (outRREQ.TargSeqNum is known)
        targSeqNumAddrBlkTlv.value := outRREQ.TargSeqNum;

    /* Build Metric Address Block TLV, include Metric AddrBlkTlv 
       Extension type if a non-default metric */
    metricAddrBlkTlv.value := outRREQ.OrigMetric;
    if (outRREQ.MetricType != DEFAULT_METRIC_TYPE)
        metricAddrBlkTlv.typeExtension := outRREQ.MetricType;
    
    if (outRREQ.ValidityTime is required)
    {
        /* Build VALIDITY_TIME Address Block TLV */
        VALIDITY_TIMEAddrBlkTlv.value := outRREQ.ValidityTime;
    }

    Build_RFC_5444_Message_Header (RREQ, 4, IPv4 or IPv6, NN,
        outRREQ.HopLimit, outRREQ.HopCount, tlvLength);

    /* multicast RFC 5444 message to LL-MANET-Routers */
}
