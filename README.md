<h1 align="center">Radio Firmware</h1>


# Important!!
## The development of this code continues in the [turpial-firmware](https://github.com/btcven/turpial-firmware) repository.

Here you can
find the main firmware for your device compatible with Locha Mesh (the radio)
and be aware of our development process.

## What's Locha Mesh?

The Locha Mesh network is a secure radio network for text messaging and bitcoin
transactions. The main objective is a long range network for everyone and
everywhere, for this reason, we are working not only in a protocol, also the
firmware for affordable devices like our "Turpial".

If you want to learn more about Locha Mesh feel free to read
[the Locha Mesh main repository](https://github.com/btcven/locha) or take a
look at our website [locha.io](https://www.locha.io).

## Sponsor.

If you want to support this project you can make a donation to the Locha Mesh
effort to build a private censorship-resistant mesh network devices for Bitcoin
and Lightning Network payments without Internet.

Here are some places if you want to support us:

- Donate: https://locha.io/donate
- Buy Turpial devices: https://locha.io/buy

## Supported boards.

This firmware should run on all the platform that Contiki-NG supports, however
our main focus is to support the SimpleLink MCUs, these are the ones used in
the Turpial board, mainly the CC1312R.

## Getting started.

First start by cloning the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/btcven/radio-firmware.git

cd radio-firmware

git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Next you need to install the necessary tools to build and correctly flash
Turpial's `radio-firmware` :

## Development workflow

Development happens in the `dev` branch, all of the Pull-Requests should be
pointed to that branch. Make sure you follow the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines. All Pull-Requests
require that at least two developers review them first before merging to `dev`
branch.

### Install build essentials (make, etc).

- Windows: you may need to install make manually or install MSYS2.
- Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install build-essentials`

### Install ARM compiler.

You should download it from [GNU-RM Downloads][arm-gcc].

#### On Ubuntu/Any Linux Distribution.

```bash
wget https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/9-2019q4/RC2.1/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2

tar xjf gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2
```

This will create a directory named
`gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major-x86_64-linux` in your current working dir.
Add `<working-directory>/gcc-arm-none-eabi-5_2-2015q4/bin` to your `$PATH`.

#### Windows.

[arm-gcc](GNU-RM Downloads) has a downloadable installer for the GCC ARM
compiler. Make sure after you have installed it that it is on your `PATH`, if not add it.

### Install Uniflash.

Install TI's [Uniflash][uniflash] tool for your operating system. This tool
allows you to upload the built firmware to the CC1312R radio module.

### Compiling the project.

The build process is very simple, just call `make` and it will build the
firmware. The built firmware is located under the `bin/` directory.

```bash
make
```

[arm-gcc]: https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads
[uniflash]: https://www.ti.com/tool/UNIFLASH

### Testing with Renode.

Currently we can test the code without using the actual SimpleLink radio MCU,
for this case we use Renode as our emulation environment. This allows us to
develop and test with more flexibility.

 - **Installing Renode**: You can follow the Renode installation guide in their
[homepage][renode], it can be installed on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.

[renode]: https://renode.io/#downloads

To build and test with renode set these environment variables:


```bash
export BOARD=cc2538dk
export RENODE_CONFIG=$(pwd)/dist/board.resc
```

Then build the firmware:

```bash
make
```

To run Renode, from the command line execute this:

```
make emulate BOARD=cc2538dk
```

**Note**: *renode needs to be in your path.*
